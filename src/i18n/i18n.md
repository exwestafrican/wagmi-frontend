# Internationalization (i18n)

This project supports multiple languages using **i18next** and **react-i18next**.

Our i18n setup is designed to:
- Support scalable multi-language UI
- Keep translations organized by feature
- Provide strong type safety
- Balance flexibility with long-term maintainability

---

## Overview

We use a **static i18n approach** where translation files are imported at build time and bundled into the application.

Key characteristics:
- Translations are part of the application bundle
- No runtime HTTP fetching for translation files
- Full TypeScript type safety for all translation keys
- Language switching is handled client-side

## Folder Structure

```txt
src/i18n/
  ├── config.ts
  ├── LanguageProvider.tsx
  ├── i18next-resources.ts
  ├── i18n.d.ts
  └── translations/
      ├── en/
      │   ├── common.json
      │   ├── auth.json

      └── fr/
          ├── common.json
          ├── auth.json
          └── home.json
```
Translation Organization
- Each language has its own folder (en, fr, etc.)
- Each feature or domain has its own file (auth, home, common)
- Files map directly to namespaces in i18next
### Adding Translations

1. Add key/value to English file: `src/i18n/translations/en/{namespace}.json`.
2. Add **same key** with **empty string** to other languages (e.g., `fr`) to satisfy type checks.

   ```yaml
   // en/home.json
    title: "Hello"

   // fr/home.json
    "title": ""
   ```

Example usage
```ts
useTranslation(auth)
t("login.title")
```
